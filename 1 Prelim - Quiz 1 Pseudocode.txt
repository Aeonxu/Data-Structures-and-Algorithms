Start with the base of the code "  #include <iostream>
using namespace std;"
	 â†“
give attributes to the variables that needs to be added, it should be "int" for integer
	 â†“
get user input for the integers that needs to be added, in this case, the prices of the items.
	 â†“
create a variable named "TheTotalSum" which will then add the given numbers and store it. (The name is optional/changeable hehe)
	 â†“
print the sum/output
	 â†“
" return 0; " to finish it up
