1st, 2nd and 3rd line of code: 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
for this example, we are going to ask for 3 subjects from the user.
we will be naming these variables as g1, g2, and g3
 â†“
ask for user input on:
Grades on 1st subject -
Grades on 2nd subject -
Grades on 3rd subject - 
 â†“
we will be naming these integer variables as g1, g2, and g3
 â†“
Then create a variable that will contain the formula and will compute the answer for you and make it a float.
 â†“
float grades = g1 + g2 + g3 / 3(the number of subjs)
 â†“
create an if-else statement within a variable, we will name it "Remarks". if the grades are equal or above 60, then print "Pass". Else, it would be "Failed"
â†“
print the grades using  cout << "Your grade is: " << grades;
â†“
print the remarks using cout << "Remarks: " << remarks;
â†“
return 0;
}
